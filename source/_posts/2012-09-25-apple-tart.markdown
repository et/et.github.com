I made this [recipe](http://www.sophisticatedgourmet.com/2011/09/easy-fig-tarts/) with the last of the figs of the season.
Then I wanted to experiment with the remaining apples from our tree.

Pretty much follow the fig recipe verbatim except use sliced apples (coat lightly in lemon juice, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tbsp nutmug).

Add a hint of cinnamon to seal the deal on presentation.
