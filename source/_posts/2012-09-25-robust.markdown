This one definitely had me working a lot on the prep and cooking. Total time from start to finish was about an hour.
Cook everything for the bell peppers, then eat the bomb-diggity-bomb salad (I just used store bought dressing).

Once you've finished that, take a breather and eat those bell peppers.

Finish up with your favorite milk chocolate.
